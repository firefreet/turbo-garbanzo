# Employee Directory
Created with React and hosted on heroku.

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## Functionality

When the user loads the page, a table of employees renders. 

The user may:

  * Sort the table by various categories

  * Filter the users by first and last name
